If you are signed in as the root user, you can create a new user at any time by typing:

adduser newuser
If you are signed in as a non-root user who has been given sudo privileges, as demonstrated in the initial server setup guide, you can add a new user by typing:

sudo adduser newuser




You can delete the user itself, without deleting any of his or her files by typing this as root:

deluser newuser
If you are signed in as another non-root user with sudo privileges, you could instead type:

sudo deluser newuser
If, instead, you want to delete the user's home directory when the user is deleted, you can issue the following command as root:

deluser --remove-home newuser
If you're running this as a non-root user with sudo privileges, you would instead type:

sudo deluser --remove-home newuser
