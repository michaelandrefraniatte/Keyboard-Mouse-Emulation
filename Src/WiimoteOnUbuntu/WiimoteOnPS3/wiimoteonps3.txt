For starting:
To play with Keyboard/mouse on ps3 or xbox, there is GIMX (Game Input Multiplexer). What you need, is a iso of ubuntu 11.10 that you install with "USB-Linux-Installer" on a usb key 2.0 formated. You reboot on this. You install ubuntu 11.10 on a partition of your hard drive computer, made automatically, after it run ubuntu by default or your windows 7, if not, enter in the terminal what is written on "doc.ubuntu-fr.org/boot-repair". Before put on a cd the recovery of your windows. If you can't recover, you need gparted live for the scrub and mbr errors, it delete the peripheral partition and repair it. After you can install GIMX. It run for me on a ps3. It's well realized for keyboard and mouse and there is config files by defaults, and you can change the parameters of the mouse and keyboard. But I think there is lot of ps3 hackers in game. I don't know on xbox.
To play with wiimote, you need lswm to connect wiimote and wminput to transfer wiimote to ppjoy. You need to start these programs with the terminal of ubuntu.
Here a zip file with my wminput script, my gimx conf file associate and a doc for what is to write in the terminal to start the wiimote script.
